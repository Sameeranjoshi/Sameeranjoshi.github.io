## **Research Interest**

Sameeran Joshi is interested in working at the intersection of Programming Languages and Computer Architecture, where he can design new abstractions and compilation techniques for existing and emerging architectures. Specifically, his research interests include programming languages, compilers, and high-performance computing (HPC). He revolves around Libraries, Languages, and Compilers.

## **Work Experience**

**Research Aide Technical (June 2024 - August 2024)**

**AMD NPU Compiler Intern, Campbell, CA**
During intern he worked on AMD AIE accelerator and IREE/MLIR compiler stack. Supported vectorized truncation,reduction kernels used in deep learning. Achieved on par speedups and faster speedups for different multidimensional matrix shapes.


**Argonne National Lab, Chicago**
He worked as a Research Aide Technical at Argonne National Laboratory as an intern over Summer'24. During his internship, he explored challenges to support the HPC/Scientific software stack on AI accelerators like Cerebras, Sambanova, Groq, GraphCore, etc... using the AI testbed at Argonne. Specific focus on compilers, programming languages, and related software stack. I specifically worked on adding a [backend](https://github.com/Sameeranjoshi/dace/commits/graphcore/) support for GraphCore based Poplar codegen into [DaCe](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Research/DAPP/) a Data-Centric Framework which helps create arbitrary dataflow graphs. 


**Compiler Engineer (July 2019 - May 2022)**

**AMD CPU Compiler Team, India**
He worked in various roles at AMD. Initially, he was working as a software verification engineer fuzzing the LLVM Compiler. He found various critical bugs and miscompilation errors in the [AOCC Compiler](https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/). Later, he worked on the LLVM Flang project, adding support for various F2008 features of the Fortran Language and OpenMP-related features in the LLVM Flang upstream compiler. He was also working on the Flang driver support in LLVM. He built an internal tool based on [LLVM Bolt](https://research.facebook.com/publications/bolt-a-practical-binary-optimizer-for-data-centers-and-beyond/) for the AOCC Compiler to analyze the performance of their HPC workloads and find missing optimizations.


### **Internship experience (Sept 2018 - April 2019)**

 **Mentor: [Andi Kleen](https://www.halobates.de/), Intel, Long time linux kernel contributor**

 **GNU Compiler Collection(GCC)**
 
He collaborated with a Google Summer of Code(GSoC) candidate on the GCC Compiler infrastructure to find bugs in the GCC compiler, extending the Time award research project Csmith for GCC C99 Language extensions. It was a fun experience getting into the compiler world by fuzzing the compiler.
