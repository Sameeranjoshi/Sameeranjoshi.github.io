## **Whoami --help**

I am a first year PhD student at the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I work as a Graduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Mary Hall](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mhall/) in the [CTOP group](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/ctop/) at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

## **Research Interest**

I am interested in working at the intersection of Programming Languages and Computer Architecture, where I can design new abstractions and compilation techniques for existing and emerging architectures. In general, my research interests are in Programming Languages, Compilers and High Performance Computing(HPC). I revolve around Libraries, Languages, and Compilers.

## **Work Experience**

**Compiler Engineer (July 2019 - May 2022)**

**AMD CPU Compiler Team, India**

I worked on various roles at AMD, I was working initially as a software verification engineer fuzzing the LLVM Compiler. Found various critical bugs, mis compilation errors in [AOCC Compiler](https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/). I worked later in the LLVM Flang project adding support for various F2008 features of the Fortran Language and OpenMP realted features in LLVM Flang upstream compiler. I was also working with the Flang driver realted stuff with amazing open source developers. This work made me more involved into the LLVM project. I worked building an internal tool based on [LLVM Bolt](https://research.facebook.com/publications/bolt-a-practical-binary-optimizer-for-data-centers-and-beyond/) for AOCC Compiler for analyzing performance of their HPC workloads and finding missing optimizations.


### **Internship experience (Sept 2018 - April 2019)**

 **Mentor: [Andi Kleen](https://www.halobates.de/), Intel, Long time linux kernel contributor**

 **GNU Compiler Collection(GCC)**

I collaborated with a Google Summer of Code(GSoC) candidate in working for the GCC Compiler infrastructure for finding bugs in GCC compiler.
It was fun experience in getting into the compiler world by fuzing the compiler. I was fortunate to be guided by many amazing open source compiler developers [Siddhesh Poyarekar](https://siddhesh.in/pages/about-me.html), [Prathamesh Kulkarni](), [Andi Kleen](https://www.halobates.de/).
